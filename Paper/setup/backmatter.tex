        I would like to thank my mentor, Kaleb Ruscitti, for his consistent support throughout the semester (even during summer break) and for guiding me through this fulfilling DRP experience. Your insights were always valuable, and I also thoroughly enjoyed our discussions about math in general. I would also like to thank the DRP committee for organizing this program; opportunities like these are hard to come by and this experience has greatly broadened my horizons.
