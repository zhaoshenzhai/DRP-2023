1. Title page
    - So the central question of our project is that...
    - Given a surface, in how many ways can we give it complex coordinates?
    - In the sense that when you zoom into the surface, it looks like the complex plane.
    - Let's look at plane $\R^2$ first.
2. $\l(x,y\r)\mapsto x+iy$
    - One way to give $\R^2$ complex coordinates is the obvious one. This gives us one way of viewing $\R^2$ as $\C$.
    - However, we can assign coordinates in any reasonable way we want, so why not something like...
3. $\l(x,y\r)\mapsto x-iy$
    - We basically reflected $\R^2$ about the $x$-axis.
    - This gives us another way of viewing $\R^2$ as $\C$.
4. Biholomorphisms
    - But the difference between those two is basically convention (just like how we always take the positive root?)
    - In fact, we can make this precise by saying that there is a biholomorphism between those two complex coordinates on $\R^2$.
    - We say that $\R^2$, equipped with the top complex structure, is biholomorphic to $\R^2$ but equipped with the bottom one.
    - So those two are actually the same.
6. Refined question
    - So instead of asking about literally how many complex coordinates there are, we only ask up to biholomorphism.
    - It turns out that there are two complex structures on $\R^2$ up to biholomorphism, and they are...
8. Two complex structures on $\R^2$
    - The one that we saw, which is the usual one, and the upper-half plane.
    - Those two are fundamentally different complex coordinates on $\R^2$, as there are no biholomorphisms between the two.
    - In fact those are the only two complex coordinates on $\R^2$.
10. Riemann surfaces
    - Now lets look at surfaces in general.
12. Classification of surfaces
14. Topological torus
16. How many complex tori?
18. Scaling doesn't matter
21. $\PSL\l(2,\Z\r)$
24. $\H/\PSL\l(2,\Z\r)$
