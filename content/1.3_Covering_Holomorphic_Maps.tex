    \section{Covering Holomorphic Maps}
    This section assumes that the reader is familiar with the basic notions of homotopic curves and liftings from algebraic topology, which we refer the reader to \cite[][Sections 4.7 $-$ 4.10]{otto}.
    \subsection{Unbranched Holomorphic Maps}
    \subsection{Proper and Covering Maps}
    \begin{definition}
        Let $X$ and $Y$ be locally compact topological spaces. A map $f:X\to Y$ is said to be \uldef{proper} if the preimage of every compact set is compact.
    \end{definition}
    \side[-0.28in]{The assumption that $X$ and $Y$ are locally compact ensures that all proper maps are closed; that is, then send closed sets to closed sets.}
    \begin{lemma}\label{1.3:lem:lemma_for_proper_covering}
        Let $X$ and $Y$ be locally compact topological spaces and let $f:X\to Y$ be a proper map. Then for every $y\in Y$ and every neighborhood $U$ of $f^{-1}\l(y\r)$, there exists a neighborhood $V$ of $y$ such that $f^{-1}\!\l(V\r)\subseteq U$.
    \end{lemma}
    \begin{proof}
        Since $U$ is open, the set $X\comp U$ is closed. Since $f$ is proper, it is closed and hence $f\l(X\comp U\r)$ is closed too. Clearly $y\not\in f\l(X\comp U\r)\eqqcolon W$, so $V\coloneqq X\comp W$ is a neighborhood of $y$; we claim that $f^{-1}\l(V\r)\subseteq U$. Indeed, for all $f\l(x\r)\in V$, we see that $f\l(x\r)\not\in f\l(X\comp U\r)$ and so $x\not\in X\comp U$.\qed
    \end{proof}
    \begin{definition}
        Let $X$ and $Y$ be locally compact topological spaces. A map $f:X\to Y$ is said to be a \uldef{covering map} if every point $y\in Y$ has a neighborhood $V$ such that $f^{-1}\l(V\r)=\bigcup_{j\in J}U_j$ where $U_j$ are disjoint open sets in $X$, each homeomorphic to $V$ via $\l.f\r|_{U_j}$.
    \end{definition}
    \begin{example}\label{1.3:exa:covering_map_power}
        Let $m\geq2$ be a natural number and consider the power map $h:\C^\ast\to\C^\ast$ mapping $z\mapsto z^m$. We claim that $h$ is a covering map, so take $b\in\C^\ast$ and let $a\in\C^\ast$ be any one of its $m^\textrm{th}$ roots. Since $h$ is a local homeomorphism, there exist neighborhoods $U_0$ of $a$ and $V$ of $b$ such that $\l.h\r|_{U_0}:U_0\to V$ is a homeomorphism. It is clear then that\side{Indeed, for all $c\in h^{-1}\l(V\r)$, $h\l(c\r)\in V$ and so there exists some $a'\in U_0$ such that $h\l(a'\r)=h\l(c\r)$. Then $c=\omega^ja'$ for some $0\leq j\leq m-1$, so $c\in\omega^jU_0$. Conversely, if $\in\omega^jU_0$ for some $0\leq j\leq m-1$, then $c=\omega^ja'$ for some $a'\in U_0$ and hence $h\l(c\r)=h\l(\omega^ja'\r)=h\l(a'\r)\in V$.}
        \vspace{-0.05in}
        \begin{equation*}
            h^{-1}\l(V\r)=\bigcup_{j=0}^{m-1}\omega^jU_0,
        \end{equation*}
        where $\omega$ is an $m^\textrm{th}$ root of unity, and since $h^{-1}\l(b\r)$ is discrete, the sets $U_j\coloneqq\omega^jU_0$ can be made small enough so that they are pairwise disjoint. Then each $\l.h\r|_{U_j}:U_j\to V$ is a homeomorphism, as desired.\exqed
    \end{example}
    \begin{proposition}
        Let $X$ and $Y$ be locally compact topological surfaces. Then any proper local homeomorphism is a covering map.
    \end{proposition}
    \begin{proof}
        Let $f:X\to Y$ be a proper local homeomorphism and take $y\in Y$. We claim that $f^{-1}\l(y\r)$ is finite.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item For each $x\in f^{-1}\l(y\r)$, there exist neighborhoods $W_x$ of $x$ and $V$ of $y$ such that $\l.f\r|_{W_x}:W_x\to V$ is a homeomorphism. Then the sets $W_x$ must be disjoint, for if $x'\in W_x$ for some $x'\neq x$, then $\l.f\r|_{W_x}\!\l(x\r)=y=\l.f\r|_{W_x}\!\l(x'\r)$, contradicting that $\l.f\r|_{W_x}$ is a homeomorphism. Thus $f^{-1}\l(y\r)$ must be finite, lest the cover $\l\{W_x\r\}$ admits no finite subcover.
        \end{itemize}
        Thus $f^{-1}\l(y\r)=\l\{x_1,\dots,x_n\r\}$ for some $x_j\in X$. Letting $W_j\coloneqq W_{x_j}$ as above, we see that $\bigcup_{j=1}^{n}W_j$ is a neighborhood of $f^{-1}\l(y\r)$. By Lemma \ref{1.3:lem:lemma_for_proper_covering}, there is a neighborhood $V$ of $y$ such that $f^{-1}\l(V\r)\subseteq\bigcup_{j=1}^{n}W_j$, so $f^{-1}\l(V\r)=\bigcup_{j=1}^{n}U_j$ where the sets $U_j\coloneqq W_j\cap f^{-1}\l(V\r)$ are all disjoint and each $\l.f\r|_{U_j}:U_j\to V$ is a homeomorphism.\qed
    \end{proof}
    \subsection{Degree of Proper Holomorphic Maps}
    \begin{defprop}
        Let $X$ and $Y$ be compact Riemann surfaces and let $F:X\to Y$ be a non-constant holomorphic map. For each $y\in Y$, define the number
        \begin{equation*}
            d_y\!\l(F\r)\coloneqq\sum_{p\in F^{-1}\l(y\r)}\mult_p\!\l(F\r).
        \end{equation*}
        Then $d_y\!\l(F\r)\in\Z$ is independent of $y$, and we define the \uldef{degree of $F$} as $\deg F\coloneqq d_y\!\l(F\r)$ for any $y\in Y$.
    \end{defprop}
    \begin{proof}
        
    \end{proof}
