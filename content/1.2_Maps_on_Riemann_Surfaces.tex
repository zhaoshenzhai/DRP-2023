    \subsection{Holomorphic Functions and Maps}
    \begin{definition}
        Let $X$ be a Riemann surface and let $W\subseteq X$ be open. For a fixed $p\in W$, a function $f:W\to\C$ is said to be \uldef{holomorphic at $p$} if there exists a chart $\tpl{U,\phi}$ of $X$ containing $p$ such that $f\circ\phi^{-1}:\phi\l(U\r)\to\C$ is holomorphic at $\phi\l(p\r)$. If $f$ is holomorphic at every point of $W$, then $f$ is said to be \uldef{holomorphic on $W$}.
    \end{definition}
    \begin{remark}\side[-0.57in]{Defining some property $P$ of $f$ using charts by transporting $f$ to a function $f\circ\phi^{-1}$ on a subset of $\C$, and borrowing $P$ from $f\circ\phi^{-1}$, will be a common theme. However, one must check that $P$ is \textit{independent of charts}; that is, if $f\circ\phi^{-1}$ satisfies $P$, then so does $f\circ\psi^{-1}$ for any other chart $\tpl{V,\psi}$.}
        It must be checked that $\textrm{`}$being holomorphic$\textrm{'}$ does not depend on the choice of chart. This is indeed the case, for if $\tpl{V,\psi}$ is another chart containing $p$, then, since
        \begin{equation}\label{1.2:eqn:holomorphic_function_well_defined}
            f\circ\psi^{-1}=f\circ\l(\phi^{-1}\circ\phi\r)\circ\psi^{-1}=\l(f\circ\phi^{-1}\r)\circ\l(\phi\circ\psi^{-1}\r):\psi\l(U\cap V\r)\to\C

        on the intersection $U\cap V$, we see that $f\circ\psi^{-1}:\psi\l(V\r)\to\C$ is also holomorphic at $p$.\exqed

    \begin{example}\label{1.2:exa:elementary_holomorphic_functions}
        Some elementary examples of holomorphic functions.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Any holomorphic function $f:W\to\C$ from an open set $W\subseteq\C$, considering $\C$ as a Riemann surface, is holomorphic in the classical sense.
            \item Any chart map $\phi:U\to\C$ of a Riemann surface is holomorphic in the above sense.
            \item If $f,g:W\to\C$ are both holomorphic at some $p\in W$, then\side{This makes the set $\mc{O}\l(W\r)$ of all holomorphic functions $f:W\to\C$ into a $\C$-algebra.} so are $f\pm g$ and $f\cdot g$. If $g\l(p\r)\neq0$, then so is $f/g$.\exqed
        \end{itemize}
    \end{example}
    \begin{definition}
        Let $X$ and $Y$ be Riemann surfaces and let $W\subseteq X$ be open. For a fixed $p\in W$, a mapping $F:W\to Y$ is said to be \uldef{holomorphic at $p$} if there exists a chart $\tpl{U,\phi}$ of $X$ containing $p$ and a chart $\tpl{V,\psi}$ of $Y$ containing $F\l(p\r)$ such that $\psi\circ F\circ\phi^{-1}\!\!:\phi\l(U\r)\to\psi\l(V\r)$ is holomorphic at $\phi\l(p\r)$. If $F$ is holomorphic at every point of $W$, then $F$ is \uldef{holomorphic on $W$}.
    \end{definition}\side[-0.7in]{For $Y\coloneqq\C$ regarded as a Riemann surface, this definition agrees with the above. Again, we must check that $\textrm{`}$being holomorphic$\textrm{'}$ is well-defined, but it follows from the commutativity of the diagram below.

    \begin{example}
        It is easy to show that the identity map $\id_X$ on a Riemann surface $X$ is a holomorphic map. Furthermore, for all Riemann surfaces $X$, $Y$ and $Z$ and holomorphic maps $F:X\to Y$ and $G:Y\to Z$, their composite $G\circ F:X\to Z$ is also a holomorphic map. This shows that the collection of all Riemann surfaces is a \textit{category}.\exqed
    \end{example}
    \begin{definition}\label{1.2:def:biholomorphic_Riemann_surfaces}
        Let $X$ and $Y$ be Riemann surfaces. A \uldef{biholomorphism between $X$ and $Y$} is an invertible holomorphic map $F:X\to Y$ whose inverse $F^{-1}:Y\to X$ is also holomorphic. Two Riemann surfaces $X$ and $Y$ are said to be \uldef{biholomorphic} if there exists a biholomorphism $F:X\to Y$.

        Let $\C_\infty$, $S^2$, and $\P^1$ denote the three constructions for the Riemann sphere $\RS$ presented in Examples \ref{1.1:one_point_compactification_of_C}, \ref{1.1:stereographic_projection}, and \ref{1.1:complex_projective_line}, respectively.

    \begin{theorem}\label{1.2:thm:holomorphic_compact_constant}
        Any holomorphic function $f:X\to\C$ on a compact Riemann surface $X$ is constant.
    \end{theorem}
    \begin{proof}
        Since $f$ is holomorphic, the function $\l|f\r|:X\to\R$ defined by $\l|f\r|\l(x\r)\coloneqq\l|f\l(x\r)\r|$ is continuous on $X$. But $X$ is compact, so $\l|f\r|$ achieves its maximum at some point $p\in X$. Choosing a connected\side{Such a connected $U$ can always be found since we may let $V$ be a chart around $p$ and choose $\epsilon>0$ small enough so that $U\coloneqq B\l(p,\epsilon\r)\subseteq V$.} chart $\tpl{U,\phi}$ centered at $p$, we see that $f\circ\phi:U\to\C$ is holomorphic. Then $\l|f\circ\phi\r|:U\to\R$ has a local maximum at $0$, so, since $U$ is connected, $f\circ\phi$ is constant by the Maximum Principle. Then $f$ is locally constant around $p$, so, since $X$ is connected, $f$ is constant on $X$.\qed
    \end{proof}
    \subsection{Singularities of Functions}
    Throughout this section, let $X$ be a Riemann surface, let $p\in X$, and let $f:W\to\C$ be defined and holomorphic on a punctured neighborhood $W$ of $p$.\side[0.01in]{That is, let $f$ be defined and holomorphic on $B\l(p,\epsilon\r)\comp\l\{p\r\}$ for some $\epsilon>0$.} As above, we can transport the behaviour of $f$ at $p$ from its chart representation $f\circ\phi^{-1}$.
    \begin{definition}
        Let $f:W\to\C$ be a holomorphic function in a punctured neighborhood of $p$. We say that $f$ has a \uldef{removable singularity} (resp. \uldef{pole}, \uldef{essential singularity}) \uldef{at $p$} if there exists a chart $\tpl{U,\phi}$ of $X$ containing $p$ such that $f\circ\phi^{-1}:\phi\l(U\r)\to\C$ has a removable singularity (resp. pole, essential singularity) at $\phi\l(p\r)$.
    \end{definition}\side[-0.56in]{Equation (\ref{1.2:eqn:holomorphic_function_well_defined}) shows that those notions are chart independent; the composition of $f\circ\phi^{-1}$ having a singularity at $p$ with a transition map that is holomorphic at $p$ yields a function with the same type of singularity at $p$.}
    \begin{remark}\label{1.2:rem:nice_singularities}
        Functions having an essential singularity at $p$ are very ill-behaved. Indeed, this occurs iff the limit of $\l|f\l(x\r)\r|$ as $x\to p$ does not exist. Other singularities behave much better:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item A removable singularity occurs iff $\l|f\l(x\r)\r|$ is bounded in a neighborhood of $p$, and can be $\textrm{`}$filled in$\textrm{'}$ by defining $\tilde{f}\l(p\r)\coloneqq\lim\limits_{x\to p}f\l(x\r)$. This makes $\tilde{f}:\tilde{W}\to\C$ into\side{$\tilde{W}\coloneqq W\cup\l\{p\r\}$.} a holomorphic function.
            \vspace{-0.08in}
            \item A pole occurs iff $\l|f\l(x\r)\r|\to\infty$ as $x\to p$, which can also be $\textrm{`}$filled in$\textrm{'}$ by defining the map
                \begin{equation*}
                    F:W\to\RS\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \textrm{mapping}\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ x\mapsto
                    \begin{dcases}
                        f\l(x\r) & \textrm{if }x\neq p \\
                        \infty & \textrm{else}
                    \end{dcases}
                \end{equation*}
                that extends the codomain of $f$ to the Riemann sphere $\RS$;\side{Here, we consider $\RS=\C_\infty$.} it is clear that $F$ is holomorphic.
        \end{itemize}
        Thus we see that every such function $f:W\to\C$ having pole at $p$ can be holomorphically extended to a map $F:W\to\RS$. Conversely, every holomorphic map $F:W\to\RS$ (that is not identically zero) can be regarded as a function $f:W\comp F^{-1}\l(\infty\r)\to\C$ that is holomorphic everywhere except where $F\l(x\r)=\infty$, in which case it either has a pole. This motivates the following definition.\exqed
    \end{remark}
    \begin{definition}
        A function $f:W\to\C$ is said to be \uldef{meromorphic at $p$} if it does not have an essential singularity at $p$; that is, if it is either holomorphic, has a removable singularity, or has a pole at $p$. If $f$ is meromorphic at every point of $W$, then $f$ is \uldef{meromorphic on $W$}.
    \end{definition}\side[-0.44in]{As in Example \ref{1.2:exa:elementary_holomorphic_functions}, if $f,g:W\to\C$ are both meromorphic at $p$, then so are $f\pm g$ and $f\cdot g$. If $g$ is not identically $0$, then so is $f/g$. This makes the set $\mc{M}\l(W\r)$ of all meromorphic functions $f:W\to\C$ into a $\C$-algebra.}
    \begin{remark}
        Remark \ref{1.2:rem:nice_singularities} can now be rephrased by saying that the set of all meromorphic functions $f:W\to\C$ are in one-to-one correspondence with the set of all holomorphic maps $F:W\to\RS$ (which are not identically zero). That is, meromorphic functions are the holomorphic maps to the Riemann sphere.\exqed
    \end{remark}
    \begin{definition}
        Let $f:W\to\C$ be meromorphic at $p$ and consider its Laurent series $\sum_{n}c_n\l(z-z_0\r)^n$ in some local coordinate $z$ with $z_0\coloneqq\phi\l(p\r)$. The \uldef{order of $f$ at $p$} is
        \begin{equation*}
            \ord_p\!\l(f\r)\coloneqq\min\l\{n\in\Z\mid c_n\neq0\r\}.
        \end{equation*}
    \end{definition}
    \side[-0.53in]{Note that $f$, being meromorphic, ensures that its Laurent series has finitely-many negative terms. Thus the set $\l\{n\in\Z\mid c_n\neq0\r\}$ achieves its minimum, so the definition makes sense. Of course, it still remains to show that $\ord_p\!\l(f\r)$ is independent of the local coordinate defining the Laurent series.\\\ \\
        The arithmetic of $\ord_p$ is straightforward. Indeed, if $f,g:W\to\C$ are meromorphic at $p$, then
        \begin{itemize}
            \item $\ord_p\!\l(fg\r)=\ord_p\!\l(f\r)+\ord_p\!\l(g\r)$.
            \item $\ord_p\!\l(f/g\r)=\ord_p\!\l(f\r)-\ord_p\!\l(g\r)$, if $g\neq0$.
            \item $\ord_p\!\l(1/f\r)=-\ord_p\!\l(f\r)$, if $f\neq0$.
            \item $\ord_p\!\l(f\pm g\r)\geq\min\l\{\ord_p\!\l(f\r),\ord_p\!\l(g\r)\r\}$.
        \end{itemize}
    }\vspace{-0.1in}
    \begin{proof}
        (Well-defined). Let $\l(U,\phi\r)$ give the local coordinates of $z$ and suppose that $\l(V,\psi\r)$ is another chart with $w_0\coloneqq\psi\l(p\r)$ giving another local coordinate $w$. Then the transition function $T:\phi\circ\psi^{-1}$ is holomorphic, so it admits a power series representation
        \begin{equation*}
            z=T\l(w\r)=\sum_{n\geq0}a_n\l(w-w_0\r)^n=z_0+\sum_{n\geq1}a_n\l(w-w_0\r)^n.
        \end{equation*}
        Since $T'\l(w_0\r)\neq0$, we see that $a_1\neq0$. Suppose now that the Laurent series of $f$ at $p$ in the coordinate $z$ is $c_{n_0}\l(z-z_0\r)^{n_0}+$ higher order terms, so that the order of $f$ at $p$ computed by employing $z$ is $n_0$. Then the Laurent series of $f$ at $p$ in the coordinate $w$ is
        \begin{equation*}
            c_{n_0}\l(\sum_{n\geq1}a_n\l(w-w_0\r)^n\r)^{n_0}+\textrm{ higher order terms},
        \end{equation*}
        whose lowest order term is $c_{n_0}a_1^{n_0}\l(w-w_0\r)^{n_0}$. Observe that $a_{n_0}=c_{n_0}a_1^{n_0}\neq0$, so the order of $f$ at $p$ computed via $w$ is also $n_0$.\qed
    \end{proof}
    \begin{remark}
        The order $\ord_p\!\l(f\r)$ can be used to classify the behaviour of $f$ at $p$. Indeed, it is readily verified that $f$ is holomorphic at $p$ iff $\ord_p\!\l(f\r)\geq0$, in which case $f\l(p\r)=0$ iff $\ord_p\!\l(f\r)>0$. Similarly, $f$ has a pole at $p$ iff $\ord_p\!\l(f\r)<0$, so $f$ has neither a zero nor a pole at $p$ iff $\ord_p\!\l(f\r)=0$. This motivates the following definition.\exqed
    \end{remark}
    \begin{definition}
        Let $f:W\to\C$ be meromorphic at $p$. We say that $f$ has a \uldef{zero} (resp. \uldef{pole}) \uldef{of order $n$ at $p$} if $\ord_p\!\l(f\r)=n>0$ (resp. $n<0$).
    \end{definition}
    \begin{example}
        Let $f:W\subseteq\RS\to\C$ be a non-zero rational function $f\l(z\r)\coloneqq p\l(z\r)/q\l(z\r)$. Then $f$ is holomorphic at all points $z\in\C$ such that $q\l(z\r)\neq0$, and has a pole otherwise. Also, $f\l(\infty\r)=c_n/d_m$ if $\deg p=\deg q$, vanishes if $\deg p<\deg q$, and has a pole otherwise. In any case, $f$ is meromorphic on $\RS$. To compute $\ord_z\!\l(f\r)$ at all $z\in\RS$, we split $p$ and $q$ into linear factors to write $f$ uniquely as
        \begin{equation*}
            f\l(z\r)=c\prod\l(z-\lambda_i\r)^{\alpha_i}
        \end{equation*}
        where $c\neq0$ and each $\lambda_i$ is distinct. Fix $i$. Setting $g_j\!\l(z\r)\coloneqq\l(z-\lambda_j\r)^{\alpha_j}$ for all $j$, we see that $\ord_{\lambda_i}\!\l(g_i\r)=\alpha_i$ and $\ord_{\lambda_j}\!\l(g_i\r)=0$ for all $i\neq j$. Thus
        \begin{equation*}
            \ord_{\lambda_i}\!\l(f\r)=\sum_j\ord_{\lambda_i}\!\l(g_j\r)=\alpha_i.
        \end{equation*}
        Moreover\side{Note that $\sum_{z\in\RS}\ord_z\!\l(f\r)=0$, which, as we shall see, holds for all compact Riemann surfaces.}, if $\alpha_i>0$ (resp. $\alpha_i<0$), then $g_i$ has a pole (resp. zero) of order $\l|\alpha_i\r|$ at $\infty$. It follows then that $\ord_\infty\!\l(g_i\r)=-\alpha_i$, so
        \begin{equation*}
            \ord_\infty\!\l(f\r)=\sum_i\ord_\infty\!\l(g_i\r)=-\sum_i\alpha_i.
        \end{equation*}
        Lastly, it is clear that $\ord_z\!\l(f\r)=0$ for all $z\neq \lambda_i,\infty$.\exqed
    \end{example}
    \subsection{Local Normal Form of Holomorphic Maps}
    \begin{theorem}[Local Normal Form]
        Let $X$ and $Y$ be Riemann surfaces and let $F:X\to Y$ be a non-constant holomorphic map. Then, for every $p\in X$, there exists a unique $m\geq1$ such that for any chart $\tpl{U_2,\phi_2}$ of $Y$ centered at $F\l(p\r)$, there exists a chart $\tpl{U_1,\phi_1}$ of $X$ centered at $p$ such that $\phi_2\circ F\circ\phi_1^{-1}:z\mapsto z^m$ for all $z\in\phi_1\l(U_1\r)$.
    \end{theorem}
    \side[-0.57in]{That is, $F$ looks like a power map $z\mapsto z^m$ locally around $p$. Since such an integer $m\geq1$ is unique, we call it the \ul{multiplicity of $F$ at $p$}, denoted $\mult_p\!\l(F\r)$.\\\ \\
        This theorem also give easy proofs of some elementary properties of holomorphic maps, which we collect here; see \cite[][section 1.2]{otto} for details. Throughout, $F:X\to Y$ is a non-constant holomorphic map between Riemann surfaces $X$ and $Y$.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item $F$ is an open map.
            \item If $F$ is injective, then it is biholomorphic onto its image.
            \item If $Y=\C$, then $\l|F\r|$ does not attain its maximum.
            \item If $X$ is compact, then $F$ is surjective and $Y$ is compact.
        \end{itemize}
        Together, the last two claims give an alternative proof for Theorem \ref{1.2:thm:holomorphic_compact_constant}.}\vspace{-0.1in}
    \begin{proof}
        Let $\tpl{U_2,\phi_2}$ be a chart of $Y$ centered at $F\l(p\r)$ and consider any chart $\tpl{V,\psi}$ of $X$ centered at $p$. Then the function $f\coloneqq\phi_2\circ F\circ\psi^{-1}$ is holomorphic, so it admits a power series representation $f\l(w\r)=\sum_{i=0}^{\infty}c_iw^i$ for all $w\in\psi\l(V\r)$. Note that $f\l(0\r)=\phi_2\l(F\l(p\r)\r)=0$, so $c_0=0$. Let $m\geq1$ be the smallest integer such that $c_m\neq0$, so
        \begin{equation*}
            f\l(w\r)=\sum_{i=m}^{\infty}c_iw^i=w^m\sum_{i=0}^{\infty}c_{i-m}w^i\eqqcolon w^mg\l(w\r).
        \end{equation*}
        Then $g$ is holomorphic at $0$ with $g\l(0\r)=c_m\neq0$, so there is a function $h$ holomorphic on some neighborhood $W$ of $0$ such that $\l(h\l(w\r)\r)^m=g\l(w\r)$ for all $w\in W$. Thus $f\l(w\r)=\l(wh\l(w\r)\r)^m$, so set $\eta\l(w\r)\coloneqq wh\l(w\r)$ for all $w\in W$. Note that $\eta'\l(0\r)=h\l(0\r)\neq0$, so $\eta$ is invertible on some neighborhood $W'\subseteq W$ of $0$. Set $U_1\coloneqq\psi^{-1}\l(W'\r)$ and $\phi_1\coloneqq\eta\circ\psi$. Then $\l(U_1,\phi_1\r)$ is a chart of $X$ centered at $p$ such that
        \begin{equation*}
            \l(\phi_2\circ F\circ\phi_1^{-1}\r)\l(z\r)=\l(\phi_2\circ F\circ\psi^{-1}\circ\eta^{-1}\r)\l(z\r)=f\l(\eta^{-1}\l(z\r)\r)=\l[\eta\l(\eta^{-1}\l(z\r)\r)\r]^m=z^m
        \end{equation*}
        for all $z\in\phi_1\l(U_1\r)$. To show uniqueness, it suffices to show that such an $m$ is chart-independent. But this is clear, for if a different chart $U_2'$ is chosen such that $F$ acts as $z\mapsto z^n$ for some neighborhood $U_1'$ of $p$, then $z^n=z^m$ on $\phi_1\l(U_1\r)\cap\phi_1'\l(U_1'\r)$ forces $n=m$.\qed
