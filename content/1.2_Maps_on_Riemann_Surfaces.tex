    \subsection{Holomorphic Functions and Maps}
    \begin{definition}
        Let $X$ be a Riemann surface and let $W\subseteq X$ be open. For a fixed $p\in W$, a function $f:W\to\C$ is said to be \uldef{holomorphic at $p$} if there exists a chart $\tpl{U,\phi}$ of $X$ containing $p$ such that $f\circ\phi^{-1}:\phi\l(U\r)\to\C$ is holomorphic at $\phi\l(p\r)$. If $f$ is holomorphic at every point of $W$, then $f$ is said to be \uldef{holomorphic on $W$}.
    \end{definition}
    \begin{remark}\side[-0.57in]{Defining some property $P$ of $f$ using charts by transporting $f$ to a function $f\circ\phi^{-1}$ on a subset of $\C$, and borrowing $P$ from $f\circ\phi^{-1}$, will be a common theme. However, one must check that $P$ is \textit{independent of charts}; that is, if $f\circ\phi^{-1}$ satisfies $P$, then so does $f\circ\psi^{-1}$ for any other chart $\tpl{V,\psi}$.}
        It must be checked that $\textrm{`}$being holomorphic$\textrm{'}$ does not depend on the choice of chart. This is indeed the case, for if $\tpl{V,\psi}$ is another chart containing $p$, then, since
        \begin{equation}\label{1.2:eqn:holomorphic_function_well_defined}
            f\circ\psi^{-1}=f\circ\l(\phi^{-1}\circ\phi\r)\circ\psi^{-1}=\l(f\circ\phi^{-1}\r)\circ\l(\phi\circ\psi^{-1}\r):\psi\l(U\cap V\r)\to\C
        \end{equation}\side[-0.45in]{

        on the intersection $U\cap V$, we see that $f\circ\psi^{-1}:\psi\l(V\r)\to\C$ is also holomorphic at $p$.\exqed
    \end{remark}
    \begin{example}\label{1.2:exa:elementary_holomorphic_functions}
        Some elementary examples of holomorphic functions.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Any holomorphic function $f:W\to\C$ from an open set $W\subseteq\C$, considering $\C$ as a Riemann surface, is holomorphic in the classical sense.
            \item Any chart map $\phi:U\to\C$ of a Riemann surface is holomorphic in the above sense.
            \item If $f,g:W\to\C$ are both holomorphic at some $p\in W$, then\side{This makes the set $\mc{O}\l(W\r)$ of all holomorphic functions $f:W\to\C$ into a $\C$-algebra.} so are $f\pm g$ and $f\cdot g$. If $g\l(p\r)\neq0$, then so is $f/g$.\exqed
        \end{itemize}
    \end{example}
    \begin{definition}
        Let $X$ and $Y$ be Riemann surfaces and let $W\subseteq X$ be open. For a fixed $p\in W$, a mapping $F:W\to Y$ is said to be \uldef{holomorphic at $p$} if there exists a chart $\tpl{U,\phi}$ of $X$ containing $p$ and a chart $\tpl{V,\psi}$ of $Y$ containing $F\l(p\r)$ such that $\psi\circ F\circ\phi^{-1}\!\!:\phi\l(U\r)\to\psi\l(V\r)$ is holomorphic at $\phi\l(p\r)$. If $F$ is holomorphic at every point of $W$, then $F$ is \uldef{holomorphic on $W$}.
    \end{definition}\side[-0.7in]{For $Y\coloneqq\C$ regarded as a Riemann surface, this definition agrees with the above. Again, we must check that $\textrm{`}$being holomorphic$\textrm{'}$ is well-defined, but it follows from the commutativity of the diagram below.

    \begin{example}
        It is easy to show that the identity map $\id_X$ on a Riemann surface $X$ is a holomorphic map. Furthermore, for all Riemann surfaces $X$, $Y$ and $Z$ and holomorphic maps $F:X\to Y$ and $G:Y\to Z$, their composite $G\circ F:X\to Z$ is also a holomorphic map. This shows that the collection of all Riemann surfaces is a \textit{category}.\exqed
    \end{example}
    \begin{definition}\label{1.2:def:biholomorphic_Riemann_surfaces}
        Let $X$ and $Y$ be Riemann surfaces. A \uldef{biholomorphism between $X$ and $Y$} is an invertible holomorphic map $F:X\to Y$ whose inverse $F^{-1}:Y\to X$ is also holomorphic. Two Riemann surfaces $X$ and $Y$ are said to be \uldef{biholomorphic} if there exists a biholomorphism $F:X\to Y$.
    \end{definition}
    \begin{example}[Biholomorphisms between Riemann spheres]\label{1.2:exa:biholomorphisms_between_Riemann_spheres}
        Let $\C_\infty$, $S^2$, and $\P^1$ denote the three constructions for the Riemann sphere $\RS$ presented in Examples \ref{1.1:one_point_compactification_of_C}, \ref{1.1:stereographic_projection}, and \ref{1.1:complex_projective_line}, respectively. We claim that the maps\side[0.28in]{Take $G\l(0,0,1\r)\coloneqq\infty$.}
        \begin{equation*}
            F:S^2\to\P^1:\tpl{x,y,w}\mapsto\proje{1-w:x+iy}\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \textrm{and}\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ G:S^2\to\C_\infty:\tpl{x,y,w}\mapsto\frac{x+iy}{1-w}
        \end{equation*}
        are biholomorphisms, which shows that all three constructions are biholomorphic.\side{Since the collection of Riemann surfaces form a category, the $\textrm{`}$is isomorphic to$\textrm{'}$ relation is an equivalence relation. Thus we are justified to call all three constructions $\textrm{`}$the$\textrm{'}$ Riemann sphere, and, henceforth, we shall denote all three by $\RS$.} Indeed $F$ is holomorphic since with the charts
        \begin{equation*}
            \begin{alignedat}{2}

            \end{alignedat}
        \end{equation*}
        we see that\side{A similar calculation shows that $G$ is biholomorphic. Indeed, we choose the same chart $\tpl{U,\phi}$, and choose $V\coloneqq\C_\infty\comp\l\{\infty\r\}=\C$ with $\psi\coloneqq\id_\C$. Then $\l(\psi\circ G\circ\phi^{-1}\r)\!\l(z\r)=z$ for all $z\in\phi\l(U\r)=\C$, and $G$ is invertible with inverse

        \end{equation*}
        which is well-defined, and since $\l(\psi\circ F\circ\phi^{-1}\r)^{-1}=\phi\circ F^{-1}\circ\psi^{-1}$, we see that $F^{-1}$ is holomorphic too.\exqed

    \subsection{Singularities of Functions}
    Throughout this section, let $X$ be a Riemann surface, let $p\in X$, and let $f:W\to\C$ be defined and holomorphic on a punctured neighborhood $W$ of $p$.\side[0.01in]{That is, let $f$ be defined and holomorphic on $B\l(p,\epsilon\r)\comp\l\{p\r\}$ for some $\epsilon>0$.} As above, we can transport the behaviour of $f$ at $p$ from its chart representation $f\circ\phi^{-1}$.
    \begin{definition}
        Let $f:W\to\C$ be a holomorphic function in a punctured neighborhood of $p$. We say that $f$ has a \uldef{removable singularity} (resp. \uldef{pole}, \uldef{essential singularity}) \uldef{at $p$} if there exists a chart $\tpl{U,\phi}$ of $X$ containing $p$ such that $f\circ\phi^{-1}:\phi\l(U\r)\to\C$ has a removable singularity (resp. pole, essential singularity) at $\phi\l(p\r)$.
    \end{definition}\side[-0.56in]{Equation (\ref{1.2:eqn:holomorphic_function_well_defined}) shows that those notions are chart independent; the composition of $f\circ\phi^{-1}$ having a singularity at $p$ with a transition map that is holomorphic at $p$ yields a function with the same type of singularity at $p$.}
    \begin{remark}\label{1.2:rem:nice_singularities}
        Functions having an essential singularity at $p$ are very ill-behaved. Indeed, this occurs iff the limit of $\l|f\l(x\r)\r|$ as $x\to p$ does not exist. Other singularities behave much better:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item A removable singularity occurs iff $\l|f\l(x\r)\r|$ is bounded in a neighborhood of $p$, and can be $\textrm{`}$filled in$\textrm{'}$ by defining $\tilde{f}\l(p\r)\coloneqq\lim\limits_{x\to p}f\l(x\r)$. This makes $\tilde{f}:\tilde{W}\to\C$ into\side{$\tilde{W}\coloneqq W\cup\l\{p\r\}$.} a holomorphic function.
            \vspace{-0.08in}
            \item A pole occurs iff $\l|f\l(x\r)\r|\to\infty$ as $x\to p$, which can also be $\textrm{`}$filled in$\textrm{'}$ by defining the map
                \begin{equation*}
                    F:W\to\RS\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \textrm{mapping}\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ x\mapsto
                    \begin{dcases}
                        f\l(x\r) & \textrm{if }x\neq p \\
                        \infty & \textrm{else}
                    \end{dcases}
                \end{equation*}
                that extends the codomain of $f$ to the Riemann sphere $\RS$;\side{Here, we consider $\RS=\C_\infty$.} it is clear that $F$ is holomorphic.
        \end{itemize}
        Thus we see that every such function $f:W\to\C$ having either a removable singularity or a pole at $p$ can be holomorphically extended to a map $F:\tilde{W}\to\RS$. Conversely, every holomorphic map $F:W\to\RS$ (that is not identically zero) can be regarded as a function $f:W\to\C$ that is holomorphic everywhere except where $F\l(x\r)=\infty$, in which case it either has a pole. This motivates the following definition.\exqed
    \end{remark}
    \begin{definition}
        A function $f:W\to\C$ is said to be \uldef{meromorphic at $p$} if it does not have an essential singularity at $p$; that is, if it is either holomorphic, has a removable singularity, or has a pole at $p$. If $f$ is meromorphic at every point of $W$, then $f$ is \uldef{meromorphic on $W$}.
    \end{definition}\side[-0.44in]{As in Example \ref{1.2:exa:elementary_holomorphic_functions}, if $f,g:W\to\C$ are both meromorphic at $p$, then so are $f\pm g$ and $f\cdot g$. If $g$ is not identically $0$, then so is $f/g$. This makes the set $\mc{M}\l(W\r)$ of all meromorphic functions $f:W\to\C$ into a $\C$-algebra.}
    \begin{remark}
        Remark \ref{1.2:rem:nice_singularities} can now be rephrased by saying that the set of all meromorphic functions $f:W\to\C$ are in one-to-one correspondence with the set of all holomorphic maps $F:W\to\RS$ (which are not identically zero). That is, meromorphic functions are the holomorphic maps to the Riemann sphere.\exqed
